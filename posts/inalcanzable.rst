**Unattainable** por *Little Joy*

Only when the goal is unattainable /
do I start to feel like I'm losing myself /
and this deep secret /
that hasn't come out yet /
is buried down deep with the rest

I can't coerce you into this one /
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed /
I'll choose unloved instead

If only songs were sung /
to guide the doubtful ones /
beyond the rough /
where not as much is good enough

Oh, if you find yourself /
amongst the lonely ones /
I will be waiting here with open arms

I can't coerce you into this one /
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed /
I'll choose unloved instead
