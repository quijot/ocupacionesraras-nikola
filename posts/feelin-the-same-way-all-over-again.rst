CÃ³mo agota sentirse siempre en el mismo lugar y pretender que no...

Encuentro en mi amiga Norah las palabras que quisiera decir o, mucho mejor, cantar.

Gracias Noritah

 The sun just slipped it's note below my door /
 And I can't hide beneath my sheets /
 I've read the words before so now I know /
 Time has come again for me /
 And I'm feelin' the same way all over again /
 Feelin' the same way all over again /
 Singin' the same lines all over again /
 No matter how much I pretend /
 Another day that I can't find my head /
 My feet don't look like they're my own /
 I'll try and find the floor below to stand /
 I hope I reach it once again /
 And I'm feelin' the same way all over again /
 Feelin' the same way all over again /
 Singin' the same lines all over again /
 No matter how much I pretend /
 Oh... /
 So many times I've wondered where I've gone /
 And how I found my way back in /
 I look around awhile for something lost /
 Maybe I'll find it in the end /
 And I'm feelin' the same way all over again /
 Feelin' the same way all over again /
 Singin' the same lines all over again /
 No matter how much I pretend /
 Feelin' the same way all over again /
 Feelin' the same way all over again /
 Singin' the same lines all over again /
 No matter how much I pretend /
 No matter how much I pretend
